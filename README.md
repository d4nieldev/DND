# DND
This is a project for OOP course of my first year studying SE
This game in a mini game of DND, the game is currently on console but is very modular and the UI may change in the future.
move/attack monsters with the keys w/a/s/d, execute special ability with q.
you need to specify a path to a directory with the levels when running the game.
You can try and add your own levels and play them! This is really fun!
